Identified Pain Points
Growth, Sclae, and Complexity
•
Poor Rep Attainment (tread lightly around this data point... this was shared with us in confidence but purposefully)
•
Based on our intel, many sales team only have 30% of their reps hitting their number. DIG INTO THIS
•
Territories are poorly designed, unequal, and quotas are aspirational and not based on good, meaningful data
•
Attrition isn’t bad... yet. Too many people have too much money in stock. Salesforce is riddled with “zombie reps”
•
No single source of truth 
•
New telephony business is a strategic initiative. Currently is managed separately. Not part of a unified revenue forecast
•
New way of running business. No way to track KPIs, what-if / scenario model, on potential outcomes in the context of the 
greater business. 
•
Renewals are a major source of revenue and an under-developed arm of the business (this comes up frequently as a 
major pain point / concern in informal conversation as well as the stated reason behind the Global Revenue 
Forecasting RFP)
•
Inability to forecast effectively
•
Forecast accuracy across net-revenue drivers including B2B, B2C, and Telephony business as well as renewals / churn
•
Hiring, onboarding, and enabling AEs month over month
•
Channel alignment – WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? NEED MORE SPECIFICS
Cost Savings
•
Plans created in Google and cannot react to business dynamics
•
Resource intensive and static
•
Plans exist in silos
•
Issues with downstream quota changes (managers are making changes, ops doesn’t see change until later... results in 
reps targeting same account, crediting / quota issues, etc.)
•
Connect spiffs and incentives to drive behavior and reduce costly errors
