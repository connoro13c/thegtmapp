Introduction



At Slack, our goal is to empower everyone to do their best work. There are elements of your performance that are not currently meeting the expectations of your role and level. The purpose of this Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) is to reinforce areas needing improvement and to help you succeed in meeting your performance goals.  



This performance improvement plan will run from 11/10/20-1/10/21. The expectation is that improvement must be sustained once goals are met, both during and after the conclusion of the PIP.





Performance ConcernsBelow, you will find the primary performance concerns in need of improvement.



Attainment/Hitting Quota/Pipeline Generation -  11% avg attainment for the last 4 quarters.  No path to quota for Q4.  Has generated the least amount of pipeline out of Enterprise West and is in the bottom 3% of the segment for pipeline generation. Has not generated any pipeline in the last 4 months.  Win rate is 12%. 



Opportunity Management & Progression - Failure to proactively provide account strategy & updates on open opportunities in SFDC & in account channels.   Account plan or Point of View is also not pinned to the accounts channel for Tier 1s.   There are often unclear next steps and lack of a joint account plan with customers. For both Q4 opportunities (MTC & Overstock), there are no deal notes and Next Steps are being used as a reminder field, not a joint plan with the customer.  Key SFDC fields including next steps frequently do not detail a mutual close plan and do not have multiple stakeholders. 



Multi-Threading & Email Outreach: Your efforts tend to be focused on working with IT project teams vs building a consensus-driven proposal by multi-threading across business lines.  Rarely multi-threads proactively or independently (without encouragement and oversight from manager). Majority of executive outreaches have been rewritten by manager to be tailored to the customer vs boilerplate.   While it is likely necessary for IT Directors to be involved, we need the buy-in from other key stakeholders across the business. An expectation of a Sr Enterprise Account Executive is that you should be having decision making + pricing/budgeting conversations early and often (not post pilot or trial), and revisiting these conversations often so that we know if something has changed.

Customer Conversations: Customer conversations often lack a deep discovery of timeline/plan/budgeting cycle, and tend to rely heavily on slideware. Cross functional partners are regularly left off of meetings, or put onto the meeting with little advance preparation or direction (for example, recent calls with Vivnit, MTC, Progrexion).   Many key accounts channels are a flurry of notes, but lack strategy and game plan. There have not been any EBCs requested during your tenure at Slack, and there has been no Exec engagement from Slack Executives over the last quarter. Manager has to regularly ask what the objective of the meeting is, what the roles & responsibilities are, and remind you to send out agendas in advance of the call. 

Working In An Unauthorized Location. Expectation to be honest and truthful with your manager, including whereabouts & location. Your SIP work address is your permanent home address (Bay Area). Your role is office based and there is no exception to working from an unauthorized location. You have been working from an unauthorized location without adhering to our Distributed Work guidelines. This is not acceptable. 

Performance Expectations

I would like to see marked improvement in the areas listed above within the next 60 days. I am here to help you fully understand, take action against, and reach the goals outlined below. I have also listed numerous examples of what “great” looks like within the appendix (pages 6-11).

Acceptable performance and engagement in your role looks like:

1. ACV Results: ACV Quota attainment >50% which is $176k.

2. Pipe Generation: $200K/month of pipe generation.  All Tier 1 Accounts get AE-driven prospecting touches to 5+ contacts at minimum quarterly. All Tier 1 Accounts have ongoing, tailored, persistent & creative outreach every month. We go wide and deep in key accounts. Must be in the upper half of SFDC dashboards. 75% of book should be actively worked, including all accounts with GPS of 75 or more. 

3. Sales Meetings: On average, you should conduct 5+ customer meetings every week, of which 2 are DIR+. Gong recordings must be  actively shared with peers and management. Demonstrate an ability to do thorough discovery & agenda setting, as well as have clarity on what evaluation and buying cycle looks like before an opportunity moves to Stage 3. Sales Lifecycle of a deal needs to be followed in order to progress deals. 

4. Multi-threading: All opportunities have a (non-IT) Stakeholder Engagement Plan prior to moving to Stage 3. All customers are presented compelling reasons to bring multiple LoBs to the discussion. The stakeholder engagement process is always actively negotiated. Clear Org charts for every Tier 1 account.

4. Business Organization & Customer Centricity: For each Key or Forecasted Account, an #accounts channel is created where regular customer-specific activity and prep is documented. Prep meetings are held at least 24 hours in advance of key meetings.  If a prep meeting is not able to be held, then prep is put into accounts channel at least 24 hours in advance with clear roles and responsibilities. Point of View (or Account Plan) is drafted and regularly reviewed with the Account Team for clarity and specific customer priorities and supporting use cases. Ability to branch out of IT/Security to sell the value of Slack, including EBCs, Value Workshops, and vision selling. Follow through on accounts by involving Slack employees and developing a strategy & POV on opportunities. 

5. Operational Excellence: Forecasting accurately and on time for ACV & Billings on a weekly basis. Big 6 in Salesforce are weekly updated on all opportunities. Including (but not limited to): Forecast in before close of business Fridays, with all opptys up to date.  Consistent hygiene that includes updating next steps, deal notes, deal judgement, mutual close plan.  Account activities and strategy demonstrated in channel. Following process, especially as it pertains to pricing & discounting, as well as legal. 

6. High Quality & Polish: Emails & outreaches should be tailored and custom to the prospects needs. There should be little to no oversight from managers in writing high quality, professional emails to Senior level stakeholders. 

7. Work Location: You need to return to your permanent home address (Bay Area) immediately. The expectation is that all employees on PIPs work from their permanent home address during SIP. If you’re not able to return immediately, you can use PTO for up to ten business days prior to resuming work from your permanent home address. 





















Next Steps

We will meet weekly to discuss your progress toward performance improvement and to share feedback with you. In three weeks we will meet again to specifically assess your overall performance. I am here to support you in developing your performance and will continue to provide support and feedback throughout the course of the plan. 

If by 1/10/21 it is determined that you are not fulfilling the expectations of your role, we will consider additional action, which may include the termination of your employment with Slack Technologies, Inc. Slack reserves the right to lengthen or shorten this PIP depending on your performance. Further, we expect sustained improvement in your performance. Should you successfully meet these objectives over the course of the plan, followed by a subsequent decline in performance, you may be terminated without further notice and opportunity to improve. Please note that this document does not change your status as an at-will employee, and that Slack retains the discretion to lengthen or shorten this plan based on your progression. Even if you successfully meet your objectives over the course of the plan, your at-will status would not change.  Please sign below indicating you have read and understand this Performance Improvement Plan in its entirety.
