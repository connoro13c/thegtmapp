The “$100 Million Dollar Ceiling”
“Our business has 
become so 
complex... our 
tools began to 
break down.”
“When we were 
small, we were 
agile. Then we 
slowed to a 
crawl. All we do is 
react now”
Our left hand 
doesn’t know 
what the right is 
doing.”
“Buying X was a 
poor, short-
sighted decision”

Unstoppable performance is an evolution
