Lost Quarter   Q2FY22
Top 3 Reasons We Lost
1.Timing (not enough of it)
2.Too slow to sell value
3.Immature buyers
“Timing: temporarily staying with internal solution 
since Twilio is concerned about using a new tool 
for their annual planning immediately after going 
live. 
They would like to revisit in January so that they 
can use Anaplan for their next planning cycle”
Company Overview
Twilio is an American cloud communications platform as a service company based in San Francisco, California. Twilio allows software developers to programmatically make and receive phone calls, 
send and receive text messages, and perform other communication functions using its web service APIs.
Executive Summary 
Twilio originally went with Adaptive Planning for Quota Planning and Capacity Planning last year. Adaptive failed and forced Twilio back into Google Sheets. They wanted to re-evaluate options for 
tooling and put Sr. Manager, Megan Lu, in charge of the evaluation. 
The primary drivers behind their evaluation was Twilio had been struggling keeping up with their scale and increase GTM operational complexity due to organic growth and M&A activity. Additionally, 
GTM leadership felt they were “leaving money on the table” due to poor territory & quota planning as well as capacity planning and talent acquisition. 
The primary features Twilio claimed to be assessing for:
-
Best of breed solution
-
We need to have the right plan and team in place to accomplish our goals
-
A system that allows us consistency and transparency to work from a single source of truth
-
Allows for flexibility
-
Drives increase productivity through operational efficiency and a better book of busines
