Vision, Strategy or Objective (Metrics, Identified Pain)

State of Idaho has hired Deloitte to migrate to a new healthcare ERP program and they require the allocation detail to uploaded

Working closely with Deloitte, we have provided a comprehensive Demo that has incorporated their Allocation Model

Our solution will dramatically increase the accuracy and fluidity of their ever-changing allocations
Top Deal #1 – State of Idaho Health & Welfare
Power (Economic Buyer, 
Champion)
Budget (Decision 
Criteria/Process, Paper Process)
TimingValue
•
The CFO for the State of Idaho
•
Key influencers are Deloitte and Dpt. 
Heads for Health and Labor
•
The RFP is being managed by 
committee that includes Legal, IT, & 
procurement
•
The Budget has been identified; 
hence an RFP has been released?
•
Once the RFP has been awarded 
PO’s will be submitted to Deloitte and 
Anaplan ?
•
The RFP has been responded too?
•
We are answering questions and 
have provided T&C’s
•
The cut over to the New ERP system 
is June 2022
•
Anaplan’s Value is time, fluidity, and 
inclusion?
•
Existing platform takes 3-4 weeks to 
be completed and has 1-2 weeks of 
changes for quarterly reporting?
Compelling EventsRisks (Competition)Mitigating StrategiesExec Alignment
•
The compelling event is their approval 
of a new ERP systems for healthcare 
LUMA and rolling in existing 
Spreadsheets is not effective and 
accurate
•
Risks include adoption and 
acceptance by both department 
heads. Control and access along with 
politics that we are not aware of are 
the biggest risks 
•
We are working closely with Deloitte 
who has the relationship and is 
already the trusted advisor that is 
moving the State to the new ERP 
system.  
•
Key executives from Deloitte have 
been driving this migration with the 
CFO, we have had multiple meetings 
with those champions which allowed 
for us to Demo prior to RFP.
