Q2 Customer Win
Win:  $2.18M NNACV | $13.6M (TCV) | $5.0M+ in Year 3
Use Cases: Seller 360 (some additional finance user licenses)
Need/Pain:  Continued Revenue Growth
As ServiceNow scales, it is increasingly difficult to meet/exceed shareholder expectations around revenue growth. It is imperative that they retain top 
sales talent and improve attainment across their expanding population of sellers. SN’s sales leadership wants to motivate sellers to “Dream Big” and 
have line of sight to crush their comp plans. In addition, ServiceNow is committed to an industry-leading approach to establishing data-driven 
propensity to buy across every target account down to the individual product level. 
Anaplan Strategic value: Driving Executional Excellence to Achieve Revenue Goals
ServiceNow’s sales leadership sees Seller 360 as a way to increase revenue and reduce cost of sales by motivating individual sellers throughout the 
fiscal year and making them more efficient and successful. Benefits include: Improving attainment across their growing population of sellers, reducing 
rep attrition and improving pay-for-performance 
Value : Retaining a single ramped sales rep yields $1.4M in top line revenue. 
Outcomes:  Improved Rep Attainment & Retention, Optimized Pay-for-Performance
All of the information that sellers need can be brought together and presented in the Seller 360 cockpit. Anaplan, unlike a BI tool, has the added 
capability of allowing sellers to perform scenario modeling to show the possibilities around various deal strategies and desired commission attainment 
goals. Strategic objectives from the CRO can be cascaded down through sales management to the individual sellers to drive behaviors in the field that 
create winning outcomes for the company. Finally, Predictive Insights provides the third-party data and AI capabilities required to establish product fit, 
ensuring sellers spend their time with customers who are most likely to buy.

Q2 Customer Win
Win:  $618(ACV) | $1.8M(TCV) | 3 years
Use Cases: T&Q
      Need/Pain:                                                                              Go-To-Market Expansion
       Sales Planning :
•
The sales planning process requires cross-functional collaboration and coordination. For FY22 sales planning, they leveraged Adaptive to run the 
planning process but ultimately, they were not able to use the system for quota setting and had to go back to GSheet. The team spent a significant 
amount of time reconciling data which caused frustration for sales leaders and delays in their ability to deploy territories and quotas. 
•
 The Snowflake team needed a platform that can support the data volumes and complexities as they grow to $10B+. As part of their SPM journey, 
Anaplan will connect their T&Q with capacity, sales forecasting, and sales crediting.
   Anaplan Strategic value :                                     Anaplan as the Catalyst for Growth 
Outcomes:                                                             Informed & Connected Decisions to Scale the Business
•
The team needed a platform that served as as the plan of record for sales planning and support the rapid changes of a high growth company. By using 
Anaplan, the team will be able to get a fast start & more bookings as quotas and territories are rolled out quickly and transparently. Equitable 
distribution will bring motivation, performance smoothing , and attrition implications.

Long term partnership between Snowflake and Anaplan
