average of key metrics including revenue growth, profitability and 
total shareholder returns. Teh ranking shows a company's 
performance relative to its competitors

last five years (where sufficient data is available). Forecasts for revenue growth, profitability and gross margin are also taken into account. The scoring methodology looks at both 
absolute performance and performance relative to peers (2) Recent trends are generally calculated over the same historical periods as outlined in note 1 (where sufficient data is 
available.) (3) Revenue growth performance may be influenced by M&A activity (e.g. significant acquisitions or divestments by the target company or its peers)

Key takeaways
•
In the year to March 2021, Gilead Sciences' 
revenues significantly increased by $2.9 billion. To 
meet investor expectations Gilead Sciences will 
have to reverse its trend and restrict decline in its 
revenue to $24.4 million (-0.1%) in each of the next 
three years. This will be challenging, given Gilead 
Sciences' largely unchanged annual growth 
(-0.6%) over the past three years.
•
Gilead Sciences' revenue jumped by 12.5% to $25.6 
billion over the last 12 months (to March 2021). 
However, average revenue for its competitors during 
the same period rose at a slower rate of 0.3%.
•
Over the past three years (to March 2021), Gilead 
Sciences' revenue remained constant despite the 
industry's annual revenue increase. While the industry 
grew annually by 5.7%, Gilead Sciences' revenue 
remained constant (-0.6%) over the past three years.

Key takeaways
•
Gilead Sciences needs to maintain its current 
level of profitability, with a -1.9 percentage points 
change - or a total of $967.7 million - over the next 
three years (to December 2023) to meet investor 
expectations. This is likely obtainable, given that 
Gilead Sciences' margins grew by 3.0 percentage 
points over the past three years.
•
Over the past two years Gilead Sciences' margins 
increased 3.7 percentage points to 51.5%.
•
Additionally, its margins remain higher than the 
industry average (37.7%). Based on profitability, 
Gilead Sciences was in the first quartile of companies 
in the Pharmaceuticals industry in March 2021.
•
Gilead Sciences' margins are expected to diminish by 
1.9 percentage points over the next three years. A 
different trend is predicted across the industry as 
margins are forecast to increase by 4.4 percentage 
points.

Glossary
MetricDescription
Cash conversion cycle
The cash conversion cycle (CCC) is one of several measures of management effectiveness. It measures how fast a company can convert cash on hand 
into even more cash on hand. The CCC does this by following the cash as it is first converted (produced) into inventory and accounts payable (AP), 
through sales and accounts receivable (AR), and then back into cash. Generally, the lower this number is, the better for the company. Although it should 
be combined with other metrics (such as return on equity and return on assets), it can be especially useful for comparing close competitors, because the 
company with the lowest CCC is often the one with better management. The formula for calculating CCC is: CCC = Days of Sales Outstanding + Days of 
Inventory Outstanding - Days of Payables Outstanding
Change in Cost 
Position (Cost Take-
out)
The method we use across all companies is to take analyst revenue and profit forecasts, to determine how much of the expected profit will come from 
sources other than expected revenue growth (scaling at the latest operating margin). Cost take out is a forward-looking metric so should be viewed as an 
estimate. Databook uses Cost Take-Out for a company to analyse whether reducing costs or growing revenue is likely to make a greater contribution to 
improving profitability. We do this by calculating the percentage of improvement in profits that Cost Take-Out represents. If this is a high percentage (above 
30%), then reducing costs will have a greater impact on improving profitability. If it is a low percentage (usually less than 20%), then boosting Revenue 
Growth is likely to be of greater importance to management.
Databook Performance 
Rank
The Databook Performance Rank is calculated as a weighted average of key metrics including Revenue Growth, profitability  (EBITDA Margin) and total 
shareholder return. The ranking shows a company’s performance relative to it competitors.
EBITDA
EBITDA – or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization – measures the size of a company’s profits. EBITDA, however, does not tell the 
whole story about how profitable a company is. It may be misleading when looked at independently of EBITDA Margin or other profitability metrics. As 
EBITDA excludes information relating to debt, it should be used with caution to assess the profitability of companies with high debt levels.
EBITDA Margin
EBITDA Margin measures a company’s profitability. It is derived from a company’s EBITIDA expressed as a percentage of the company’s total revenue. 
EBITDA Margin is an important metric for assessing the profitability and efficiency of a company. A high EBITDA Margin indicates that a company’s 
operating costs are small in relation to its total revenue. As EBITDA Margin takes into account employee salaries – usually one of the largest costs for a 
company – it is a good benchmark for understanding how efficient a business is compared to its competitors. It excludes financing costs, so is generally a 
better measure of operational performance than Net Income or other profitability metrics.

Glossary
MetricDescription
EBT (excluding 
exceptional items)
EBT – or Earnings before Taxes – is commonly used as a measure of profit in the financial services industries. Unusual items include asset write-downs, 
impairments of goodwill, restructuring charges, one-time changes in taxation or other non-recurring items that will not affect forward operations.
EBT Margin (excluding 
exceptional items)
This metric is commonly used to measure profitability in the financial services industries. It is calculated by expressing a company’s EBT as a percentage 
of total revenue. It is the inverse of another metric commonly used in the banking industry: Cost/Income Ratio.
Financial Strengths 
and Weaknesses
Databook analyses a company’s financial performance across six key metrics. Our algorithm looks at financial performance relative to peers over the last 
12 months and the previous three reporting periods. The algorithm will also look at investor expectations for revenue and profitability based on analyst 
consensus estimates. The most recent financial performance is weighted more strongly than historical or future performance. Databook uses this scoring 
to determine whether a company’s performance for each metric has been ‘strong’, ‘average’ or ‘weak’. Financial strengths and weaknesses are displayed 
on the Executive Summary slide.
Gross Margin
Gross Margin represents the percentage of sales revenue that accrues to the company after it has accounted for the direct costs associated with 
producing the products or services it sells. If a company’s Gross Margin is falling, it may decide to cut costs (e.g. labour, supplier, materials costs) or 
increase the prices of its goods or services. We calculate Gross Margin using this formula: Gross Margin (%) = (Total revenue – Cost of goods sold) / Total 
revenue.
Profitability
Databook generally uses EBITDA Margin to measure profitability at company group level. To measure profitability at business segment level, Databook 
generally uses EBT Margin as this is more commonly reported. For companies in the financial services industries (i.e. Banks, Capital Markets, Consumer 
Finance, Diversified Financial Services,  and Insurance), Databook generally uses EBT Margin (excluding exceptional items).See EBITDA Margin and 
EBT Margin for more detail.

MetricDescription
Revenue
For many companies, revenue is largely equivalent to sales, but can also include other sources of income such as royalties or returns on investment.
Revenue Growth
Revenue Growth measures the percentage increase (or decrease) in a company’s revenue over time. Revenue Growth helps business and sales 
executives to identify which companies are growing fastest. It also allows companies of different sizes or reporting in different currencies to be compared. 
Databook provides Revenue Growth over a range of time periods, allowing you to account for seasonal variations in some businesses (e.g. Toys R Us is 
likely to sell more toys in the holiday season). Revenue growth may also be impacted by M&A activity.
Revenue Per Employee
Revenue Per Employee is a measure of how efficient a company is. High Revenue Per Employee suggests that the company’s workforce are highly 
productive. As Revenue Per Employee varies significantly between different industries, it is best to only use this metric to compare companies within the 
same industry. We calculate Revenue Per Employee as total revenue divided by number of employees.
SG&A Efficiency
Selling, General & Administration (SG&A) represents the total expenses relating to the support functions of a company. SG&A costs do not relate directly 
to the creation of the product or service being sold, but to selling, promoting and delivering it e.g. Sales, customer support, IT, Finance, HR. SG&A 
Efficiency is equivalent to SG&A costs as a percentage of total revenue. This metric provides a useful insight into the productivity of the company’s support 
functions and their contribution to generating revenue. Generally, falling SG&A Efficiency is a positive sign, as long as the company’s revenue is growing.
Stock Price
Databook includes information about a company’s Stock Price. We tend to focus on the percentage change in the Stock Price over time, rather than its 
monetary value, as this gives an indication of whether the company’s recent performance and strategy has been viewed positively or negatively by 
investors.
Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR)
DatabookTotal shareholder return (TSR) measures the performance of a company’s shares over time. TSR is calculated by adding any increase (or 
decrease) in the share price to the value of dividends paid. It is a crucial metric for publicly listed companies, both as it informs future expectations for the 
company and is a major component of variable compensation for senior management. TSR also offers an easy way to compare a company’s relative 
performance against competitors. It is expressed for periods of more than one year as a compound annual growth rate (CAGR).
