Anaplan Thought 
Map (Anaplan 
August 21)
Samplepunch line: across 
the McKinstry portfolio of 
services, using Anaplan to 
achieve:
1.Cross-LOB/practice 
area financial reporting 
with real-time scenario 
analysis
2.Project-based planning:  
staffing, margins, 
budgeting –BVA 
reporting at project 
level

Hello McKinstry team,
Within this deck is a draft of a planning scenario for McKinstry based on 
public research. An application of cross-practice area financial reporting and 
project-based planning with real time budget-versus-actuals scenario 
reporting stood out as an interesting area of focus. Other customers like 
Gensler and Jacobs in AEC are using Anaplan similarly. Called them out 
specifically because I have worked with them in the past regarding Anaplan 
initiatives.
For purposes of introduction, I am your Anaplan Account Executive and look 
forward to the opportunity to meet with you to further tailor a business case 
for McKinstry.

•Similar organization of the 
business to McKinstry: 
planning both by geography 
and business unit but also 
by practice area (education, 
civic, energy, etc.)

Intended Next Steps
Rather than a product-
focused pitch meeting, my 
intended next step is to find a 
McKinstry problem or 
planning gap that a 
connected planning 
environment can solve for.
