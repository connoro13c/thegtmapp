Customer Health & Adoption

Q1 Overdrive – Gap to PLAN
Zoom – Sales – Currently Forecasted at 150k (Territory + PI) but potential to expand with larger deployment and / or ELA play
•
Option 1 - Expand Territory Rollout
•
Territory Planning for 42 sales mgrs (one segment for a MVP) and 1,200 reps = 668k
•
Option 2 – Sales ELA
•
 All Sales Managers and Reps (1,550) + 20 ops / model builders  = 1,570 users x 780.00 = 1,225k
•
Planning + pi bundle includes T&Q, sales coverage, account planning and account segmentation w/ PI
•
Option 3: Could look to bundle / attach Summit success, Hypercare, HyperConnect, and Hypermodel SKUs
•
RISK: Larger deal could slow down sales cycle
Coupang – CapEx – Currently out of forecast but could be additional 200 - 300k
•
Context – Funkiness with Korean HQ, big meeting next Tuesday to determine viability, prospect indicated “stretch goal” for Q1 buy (they are on 
Calendar Year)
•
RISK: Still early stages. Not sure how “real” the deal is.
AirBnB – Currently out of forecast but could be additional 200k
•
Context – BlueBird inbound through SDR. Urgent need to manage new growth. Access to buyers and eager to grow Anaplan footprint. Viability 
of deal will be assessed further in 2 weeks.
•
RISK: Still early stages. Maye not be able to move fast enough.
 
Cost Plus – Currently out of forecast but could be additional 100 - 200k
•
Context – Funkiness with Korean HQ, big meeting next Tuesday to determine viability, prospect indicated “stretch goal” for Q1 buy (they are on 
Calendar Year)
•
RISK: Dan swears it is a real deal. Not sure how much I believe him. Need to validate further.
