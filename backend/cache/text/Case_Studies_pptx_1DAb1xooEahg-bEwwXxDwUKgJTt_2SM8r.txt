Case Studies

Case Study: FP&A
Problems
•
Creating financial plans multiple times 
throughout the year for different stakeholders 
(for board, divisions, CEO/CFO) in excel. 
•
Financial planning is not a fluid or dynamic plan. 
It's based on a static report that gets produced 
once a year (oct)
•
No version controls 
•
No ability to do scenario analysis/what if 
analysis 
•
Spending too much time manipulating data of 5  
financial statements from all the divisions into 1 
corporate financial statement
ROI
•
Currently spending 50% of time planning, which 
could now be spent forecasting and analyzing 
•
Increased data accuracy
•
Creating one source of truth will alleviate the 
unclarity around the final output. Assumptions 
can be documented and tracked. Current 
process takes weeks, could be done in 1 day. 
•
Better understand financial drivers and impact 
to the business through integrated scenario 
analysis. 
•
Provide more guidance to the divisions, allowing 
for short, medium and long-range planning. 
Allow for early identification of financial 
opportunities.

Case Study: ERM
Problems- Insurance budget
•
The ERM group relies on company wide data 
that is not contained in a single system. All 
external data must be manually entered, 
validated and adjusted, which takes a lot of 
time. 
•
No ability to do scenario planning or versions 
control.
•
No ability to accurately see YOY change and 
variance analysis 
•
Scenario is based on forecast instead of actuals. 
•
1 excel workbook with 35 Excel sheets with 
messy formulas 
ROI
•
Scenario analysis can be easily done, shortening 
timeline from 2 weeks to 1 day to deliver final 
product
•
Saving 2-3hrs a day over a  3-month period. 
•
Having a system where analysis can be easily 
performed creates an understanding of drivers. 
This allows for effective communication with 
stakeholders
•
Having a streamlined process provides 
confidence in calculations and data
•
Creates a database with historical values. 
•
Allows for variance analysis which is currently 
not possible. (rate of error can currently not be 
tracked) 

Case Study: ERM
Problems- Statement of Values
•
The ERM group relies on company wide data that 
is not contained in a single system. All external 
data must be manually entered, validated and 
adjusted, which takes a lot of time. 
•
Data is not compatible with each other (hierarchy 
names are different in different sources)
•
No ability to accurately see YOY change and 
variance analysis  
•
Insurance premiums and claim payments are 
based on values, which is currently under or 
overstated. This causes a huge risk to the business
•
Rate of error can currently not be tracked 
•
Static document that stakeholders do not have the 
ability to reference throughout the year to inform 
asset management (both internal & external)
ROI
•
Saving 6 hrs. a day over a 4 weeks period. 
•
Having an accurate system can help internal 
stakeholders manage their business better.
•
Accurate and reliable data can help create more 
constant insurance premiums YOY. This allows 
better financial budgeting. 
•
Creates a database with historical values to allow 
for variance analysis YOY. 
•
Having a reliable & real time database, would help 
WE comply and stay ahead of regulatory 
challenges.
•
Clear understanding of what locations have what 
assets for footprint analysis 

Case Study: Sales Incentive Plan
Problems
•
New sales incentive plan project is underway a 
key objective for the project team is to define 
an improved methods for tracking and reporting 
sales incentive plan activities. 
•
Current spreadsheet methods for tracking sales 
incentives are labor intensive and lead to errors 
in the data.
•
 Sensitive data that does not have sharing 
controls
•
No standardization for target setting across 
regions. Each DSM has their own target setting 
mechanism
•
Data consistency issues and problems 
consolidating sheets, formulas & version control
•
No ability to do scenario analysis or forecasting
ROI
•
Spending too much time doing data 
manipulation in Excel. Integrated system would 
save  8-10% of teams  total time throughout the 
year which can now be spent on analysis
•
A standardize target setting process that can be 
tracked by individual salespeople & managers 
throughout the season/year. 
•
Improve the incentive management process to 
align better with increased sales effort and 
financial rewards and create transparency.
•
Ensure protection of Sensitive data 
•
Confidence in the data and process allowing for 
better communication with stakeholders. 

Case Study: Treasury
Challenges
•
Lack of adequate visibility into global daily cash 
positions in corporate and affiliate bank accounts
•
No proper tool for short-term and long-term (13 week) 
cash forecasting
•
Requires significant manual effort
•
Limited view of corporate liquidity picture to make 
optimal capital and financing decisions
•
Manual tracking and reporting of capital structure, 
specifically debt portfolio, to manage bank relationships 
and financing exposure 
•
Inability to track global currency risk and exposure 
efficiently
•
Significant effort involved in ensuring data integrity 
across the divisions as it is very bespoke and 
fragmented
ROI
•
Develop ability to quickly analyze our capital and 
liquidity position and how to optimize it 
•
Improved data integrity and accuracy
•
Enhanced visibility into global cash positions
•
Enhanced controls and governance overnight for 
Treasury processes
•
Established cash forecasting process to pre-empt 
capital and liquidity needs 
•
Perform variance analysis to run analytics and 
identify trends
•
Proper tracking and reporting to manage current debt 
portfolio that drives informed discussions with lenders
