The Digital Asset Investing Platform for 
Professional Wealth Managers

In the decade since the 2008 financial collapse, the world of finance has been transforming. Digital assets 
have played an increasing role in this transformation and in the last two years have begun to enter the 
mainstream. As digital assets gain traction, an increasing number of financial instruments are migrating to next 
generation infrastructure, enabling historically unparalleled transparency and control.

The Problem
Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) are tasked with the challenge to diversify 
client portfolios in the face of extreme uncertainty during an unprecedented 
time. 
There is mounting pressure, from both clients and institutions, to invest in digital 
assets but no solution that is intuitive, safe, and compliant.
