Investor Expectations For Synaptics
HOW DO ANAPLAN SOLUTIONS ALIGN WITH EXPECTATIONS FOR SYNAPTICS?
Revenue Growth
In the year to June 2021, Synaptics' revenue growth leveled 
off. To meet investor expectations Synaptics will have to 
reverse this trend and increase revenues by $124.2 million 
(9.3%) in each of the next two years. This will be challenging, 
given Synaptics' annual decline of -6.3% over the past two 
years.

AVERAGE
Profitability
Synaptics needs to grow profits by 14.6 percentage points - or 
a total of $203.1 million - over the next two years (to June 
2023) to meet investor expectations. This will be difficult, 
despite Synaptics' margins growing by 11.3 percentage points 
over the past three years.

Key takeaways
In the year to June 2021, Synaptics' revenue growth 
leveled off. To meet investor expectations Synaptics will 
have to reverse this trend and increase revenues by 
$124.2 million (9.3%) in each of the next two years. This 
will be challenging, given Synaptics' annual decline of 
-6.3% over the past two years.
Over the past year (to June 2021), Synaptics' revenue 
hovered at $1.3 billion. Its competitors' revenues grew by an 
average of 23.5%.
Over the past three years (to June 2021), Synaptics' revenue 
declined despite an increase in the industry average. While 
the industry grew annually by 10.4%, Synaptics' revenue 
declined by 4.2% over the past three years.
Over the next two years, investors assume revenue for the 
industry will grow at an average annual increase of 14.0% to 
June 2023.

Key takeaways
Synaptics needs to grow profits by 14.6 percentage 
points - or a total of $203.1 million - over the next two 
years (to June 2023) to meet investor expectations. This 
will be difficult, despite Synaptics' margins growing by 
11.3 percentage points over the past three years.
Over the past two years, margins at Synaptics rose by 2.1 
percentage points to 15.8%.
However, relative to the industry average (22.1%), it has 
lower margins. Based on profitability, Synaptics was in the 
third quartile of companies in the Semiconductors & 
Semiconductor Equipment industry in March 2021.
The competitive landscape includes top performers, such as 
Ambarella, whose margins are expected to increase over the 
next two years by 37.9 percentage points, Silicon 
Laboratories by 9.9 percentage points, and Himax 
TechnologiesAdr by 9.8 percentage points.

MetricDescription
Cash conversion 
cycle
The cash conversion cycle (CCC) is one of several measures of management effectiveness. It measures how fast a company can convert cash on hand 
into even more cash on hand. The CCC does this by following the cash as it is first converted (produced) into inventory and accounts payable (AP), 
through sales and accounts receivable (AR), and then back into cash. Generally, the lower this number is, the better for the company. Although it should 
be combined with other metrics (such as return on equity and return on assets), it can be especially useful for comparing close competitors, because the 
company with the lowest CCC is often the one with better management. The formula for calculating CCC is: CCC = Days of Sales Outstanding + Days of 
Inventory Outstanding - Days of Payables Outstanding
Change in Cost 
Position (Cost 
Take-out)
The method we use across all companies is to take analyst revenue and profit forecasts, to determine how much of the expected profit will come from 
sources other than expected revenue growth (scaling at the latest operating margin). Cost take out is a forward-looking metric so should be viewed as an 
estimate. Databook uses Cost Take-Out for a company to analyse whether reducing costs or growing revenue is likely to make a greater contribution to 
improving profitability. We do this by calculating the percentage of improvement in profits that Cost Take-Out represents. If this is a high percentage 
(above 30%), then reducing costs will have a greater impact on improving profitability. If it is a low percentage (usually less than 20%), then boosting 
Revenue Growth is likely to be of greater importance to management.
Databook 
Performance Rank
The Databook Performance Rank is calculated as a weighted average of key metrics including Revenue Growth, profitability (EBITDA Margin) and total 
shareholder return. The ranking shows a company's performance relative to it competitors.
EBITDA
EBITDA - or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization - measures the size of a company's profits. EBITDA, however, does not tell the 
whole story about how profitable a company is. It may be misleading when looked at independently of EBITDA Margin or other profitability metrics. As 
EBITDA excludes information relating to debt, it should be used with caution to assess the profitability of companies with high debt levels.
EBITDA Margin
EBITDA Margin measures a company's profitability. It is derived from a company's EBITIDA expressed as a percentage of the company's total revenue. 
EBITDA Margin is an important metric for assessing the profitability and efficiency of a company. A high EBITDA Margin indicates that a company’s 
operating costs are small in relation to its total revenue. As EBITDA Margin takes into account employee salaries – usually one of the largest costs for a 
company – it is a good benchmark for understanding how efficient a business is compared to its competitors. It excludes financing costs, so is generally a 
better measure of operational performance than Net Income or other profitability metrics.

MetricDescription
EBT (excluding 
exceptional items)
EBT - or Earnings before Taxes - is commonly used as a measure of profit in the financial services industries. Unusual items include asset write-downs, 
impairments of goodwill, restructuring charges, one-time changes in taxation or other non-recurring items that will not affect forward operations.
EBT Margin 
(excluding 
exceptional items)
This metric is commonly used to measure profitability in the financial services industries. It is calculated by expressing a company's EBT as a percentage 
of total revenue. It is the inverse of another metric commonly used in the banking industry: Cost/Income Ratio.
Financial Strengths 
and Weaknesses
Databook analyses a company's financial performance across six key metrics. Our algorithm looks at financial performance relative to peers over the last 
12 months and the previous three reporting periods. The algorithm will also look at investor expectations for revenue and profitability based on analyst 
consensus estimates. The most recent financial performance is weighted more strongly than historical or future performance. Databook uses this scoring 
to determine whether a company’s performance for each metric has been 'strong', 'average' or 'weak'. Financial strengths and weaknesses are displayed 
on the Executive Summary slide.
Gross Margin
Gross Margin represents the percentage of sales revenue that accrues to the company after it has accounted for the direct costs associated with 
producing the products or services it sells. If a company's Gross Margin is falling, it may decide to cut costs (e.g. labour, supplier, materials costs) or 
increase the prices of its goods or services. We calculate Gross Margin using this formula: Gross Margin (%) = (Total revenue - Cost of goods sold) / Total 
revenue.
Profitability
Databook generally uses EBITDA Margin to measure profitability at company group level. To measure profitability at business segment level, Databook 
generally uses EBT Margin as this is more commonly reported. For companies in the financial services industries (i.e. Banks, Capital Markets, Consumer 
Finance, Diversified Financial Services, and Insurance), Databook generally uses EBT Margin (excluding exceptional items).See EBITDA Margin and 
EBT Margin for more detail.

MetricDescription
Revenue
For many companies, revenue is largely equivalent to sales, but can also include other sources of income such as royalties or returns on investment.
Revenue Growth
Revenue Growth measures the percentage increase (or decrease) in a company’s revenue over time. Revenue Growth helps business and sales 
executives to identify which companies are growing fastest. It also allows companies of different sizes or reporting in different currencies to be compared. 
Databook provides Revenue Growth over a range of time periods, allowing you to account for seasonal variations in some businesses (e.g. Toys R Us is 
likely to sell more toys in the holiday season). Revenue growth may also be impacted by M&A activity.
Revenue Per 
Employee
Revenue Per Employee is a measure of how efficient a company is. High Revenue Per Employee suggests that the company’s workforce are highly 
productive. As Revenue Per Employee varies significantly between different industries, it is best to only use this metric to compare companies within the 
same industry. We calculate Revenue Per Employee as total revenue divided by number of employees.
SG&A Efficiency
Selling, General & Administration (SG&A) represents the total expenses relating to the support functions of a company. SG&A costs do not relate directly 
to the creation of the product or service being sold, but to selling, promoting and delivering it e.g. Sales, customer support, IT, Finance, HR. SG&A 
Efficiency is equivalent to SG&A costs as a percentage of total revenue. This metric provides a useful insight into the productivity of the company’s 
support functions and their contribution to generating revenue. Generally, falling SG&A Efficiency is a positive sign, as long as the company's revenue is 
growing.
Stock Price
Databook includes information about a company's Stock Price. We tend to focus on the percentage change in the Stock Price over time, rather than its 
monetary value, as this gives an indication of whether the company's recent performance and strategy has been viewed positively or negatively by 
investors.
Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR)
Databook Total shareholder return (TSR) measures the performance of a company's shares over time. TSR is calculated by adding any increase (or 
decrease) in the share price to the value of dividends paid. It is a crucial metric for publicly listed companies, both as it informs future expectations for the 
company and is a major component of variable compensation for senior management. TSR also offers an easy way to compare a company's relative 
performance against competitors. It is expressed for periods of more than one year as a compound annual growth rate (CAGR).
